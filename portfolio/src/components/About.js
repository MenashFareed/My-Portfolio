            Hi! I'm Menash, a senior data analyst with a background in software engineering. 
            With a strong foundation in both technical and leadership roles,
            I specialize in designing, scaling, and maintaining seamless, user-centric databases and 
            business intelligence dashboards, while maintaining robust security practices.
          </p>
          <p className="bio-text">
            I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering from the 
            University of Western Ontario, Canada. In addition, I had completed
            a co-op along with a standing on the honour roll. 
          </p>
          <p className="bio-text">
            My journey in technology started in my first year of university, where I 
            was introduced to the world of software development. After passing my first 
            CS course I knew that this was the engineering field I wanted to pursue.
          </p>
          <p className="bio-text">
            Aside from the techincal life, I am a huge sports fan. I'd play anything from
            fencing to soccer to volleyball.
          </p>
          <p className="bio-text">
            I also have an interest towards gaming. Halo, Valorant, and TFT would be my top 3
            recommendations.
